# Abstract

We investigate how human activity influences the movement patterns of wild animals. Using tracking data from red foxes, bobcats, and coyotes across rural and remote areas in England, Canada, and the US, we analyze home range sizes and habitat selection in relation to human footprint and land cover.

# Introduction

Disturbance by humans has widespread impacts on the movements of animals, as confirmed by a large-scale meta study by @doherty2021human. In this paper, two related research questions are addressed:

1.  Home range size implications: Do animals exhibit smaller home ranges in high human impact areas? This is examined by comparing red fox (*vulpes vulpes*) home ranges in low and high human impact areas.
2.  Habitat selection in human-influenced landscapes: How do animals select habitats under varying levels of human presence? This is analysed based on bobcat (*lynx rufus*) and coyote (*canis latrans*) data from a national park area.

Different data sets are used for each research question. Relying on Movebank data, as described in @sec-movebank, presents additional challenges because data is used for purposes it was not originally collected for, and compared between different studies.

# Material and Methods

This section describes the data sets, the steps taken to prepare and process the different data sets in use, and the methodological approach.

## Data sets

The Movebank database by @kays2022movebank enables researchers to publish animal tracking data for public use. The following data is selected: Red fox data from @porteus2024movement for the outskirt areas of villages in Wiltshire, UK and from @lai2022red for the remote uninhabited islands Bylot and Herschel in Canada, and bobcat and coyote data from @prugh2023fear for remote areas with some rural structures in northern Washington, US. For the human footprint data, the global terrestrial human footprint data by @gassert2023operational is chosen. For land cover, satellite data described in @zanaga2022esa is employed.

## Data preparation and processing

This section describes data preparation and processing for all the datasets employed.

### Movebank data {#sec-movebank}

All Movebank data sets have the same schema. This simplifies data handling, enables code re-use, and requires the data contributors do perform preprocessing and data cleaning on their side to provide the data in an appropriate format. Libraries for data processing and trajectory handling in R are provided by @kranstauber2024move2 and @signer2019animal.

The R code for data download, preprocessing, and serialization of relevant data and charts can be found in: [Red fox: UK wader nesting season home ranges](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_uk_wader_nesting_season_home_range.html), [Red fox: montly home ranges](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_monthly_home_ranges.html), TBD Bobcat/coyote.

### Human footprint data

The global 100 meter resolution terrestrial human footprint data (HFP-100) is a raster data set using Mollweide projection as described by @lapaine2011mollweide. The 2020 version of the data was used. The relevant areas were downloaded using a 125 km buffer around the tracking points, and projected to the WGS84 coordinate system: [HFP-100 download](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_HFP_subsetting.html).

### Land cover data

The relevant European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover 2021 data at 10 m resolution was downloaded via the Microsoft Planetary Computer [STAC API](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/quickstarts/reading-stac/) for simple programmatic access in R: [ESA download](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_ESA_world_cover.html).

## Data exploration and analysis

This section describes the data exploration steps taken for read fox data, and for bobcat/coyote data.

### Red fox data {#sec-redfoxdata}

Data from Wiltshire (see @fig-wiltshire-map) was collected between 2016 to 2019 during the UK wader nesting season, which was defined to be March 15th to June 15th, for 35 foxes in total. It was sampled at 10 and 60 minute rates. The research team controlled the sampling rate remotely to save battery at times the data was considered less interesting.

Data from Bylot (see @fig-bylot-map) and Herschel (see @fig-herschel-map) was collected all year round, at a much lower sampling rate of once per day at random afternoon times of the day. The collection period was June 2009 to Feb 2010 for Herschel and from 2011 to 2015 for Bylot, for two foxes each per island. @fig-datapoints-year provides an overview of the amount of data points available per year. There is much more data from Wiltshire because of the higher number of foxes and the higher sampling rate. Looking at the breakdowns by month as shown in @fig-datapoints-month reveals seasonal differences in the amount of data available.

### Bobcat and coyote data

The bobcat and coyote data from @prugh2023fear contains data for 29 coyotes and 30 bobcats collected between June 2018 and June 2022. They reside in two separated geographical areas and have species-interspersed home ranges as shown in @fig-esa, which features a plot of the bobcat and coyote locations in the context of the extracted land cover data. @fig-hfp reveals the human footprint in the area, which is generally low except for some settlements and country roads.

![HFP-100 data with bobcat and coyote tracks shown in black and relevant area in red](img/hfp.png){#fig-hfp width="85%"}

The data sampling intervals are intended to be four hours. In practice, they are irregular with many outliers (see @fig-bobcat-coyote-sampling-outliers), and differ between the two species. The bobcat intervals are less dense and less regular in comparison. @fig-bobcat-coyote-sampling shows a boxplot for the sampling intervals with outliers removed for readability.

## Methodology {#sec-methodology}

### Home range size assessment

The red fox data is used for home range size assessment for rural and remote locations. Home range sizes are calculated using minimum convex polygons. This provides estimates of the area used by each individual animal that are easy to compare to each other.

As discussed in @sec-redfoxdata, the data for the two locations have different temporal scale. @laube2011 have found that the choice of temporal scale has considerable effects on movement parameter calculations, in turn affecting home range results.

How to make this data comparable? Problem #1 is that the sampling intervals are different. Problem #2 is that the data coverage varies by time of the year. Problem #3 is that there are highly different amounts of data. Selecting the means and parameters for the comparison involves complex choices that will influence the results.

For #1, a possible approach to achieve similar sampling intervals would be to sample a random afternoon data point for each 24 hour window. However, this would include the implicit assumption that foxes will follow similar daily patterns in the different environments. For #2, a possible approach would be to compare the data for the same time of the year. But since the geographical locations are different, the seasonal weather conditions will differ for the same day of the year, likely leading to different animal behavior. For #3, aggregated comparisons can solve the issue, assuming there is enough data for the smaller data source.

For data exploration the simplest possible imperfect approach is employed, which is to ignore the different sampling intervals for problem #1, to compare the data for the same time of the year for problem #2 even if animal behavior might be different, and to use exploratory data analysis to find out if a representative answer can be found given the amount of data present for problem #3. Note that this approach has obvious limits. Among them is that the Herschel data is not applicable, since it has minimal overlaps with the Wiltshire data (see @fig-datapoints-month).

To explore the impact of sampling intervals for problem #1, the home ranges for the Wiltshire data are additionally calculated on downsampled data, where a random data point from every 24 hour period is selected.

Finally, an analysis of monthly home ranges is conducted on all three data sets as an alternative solution to address problem #2.

### Trajectory analysis and habitat selection

Movement paths are analyzed to identify patterns in speed, direction, and habitat use. Step lengths and turning angles help infer behavioral states. Step-selection functions (SSFs) as described by @fortin2005wolves are employed to detect habitat preferences relative to movement patterns. This allows to quantify how animals respond to environmental covariates, such as human footprint and land cover. Selection patterns across species and regions are then compared to assess how habitat preferences vary with human influence.

Since SSFs require a regular sampling rate which the original data does not provide (see @fig-bobcat-coyote-sampling), the animals tracks were re-sampled to a four hour window for coyotes and an eight hour window for bobcats. The amt library's track_resample() function by @signer2019animal was used, with a specified tolerance window of 10 minutes. The re-sampled tracks are translated into animal steps with certain step lengths and turning angles as the main input to the SSF. The control group for statistical analysis is comprised of randomly generated steps.

To compare land cover choices, which translate into habitat characteristics, several statistical approaches are possible. The classical approach is to use conditional logistic regression to compare between observed and random steps (clogit, see @manly2007resource). However, for datasets containing several animals, a Poisson-based approach with stratum-specific fixed intercepts as introduced by @muff2020accounting is likelihood-equivalent and often returns better results. Interpreting the intercepts as random effects allows implementation as a generalized linear mixed model (GLMM, see @bolker2009generalized), which in turn enables introducing random slopes per individual animal.

# Results

The resulting home ranges for the UK wader nesting season time frame are shown in @fig-home-ranges-bylot and @fig-home-ranges-wiltshire. The median home range size for the foxes in Bylot (75.3 km<sup>2</sup>) is more than 65 times bigger compared to the foxes in Wiltshire (1.1 km<sup>2</sup>). The home ranges for the sub-sampled Wiltshire data are shown in @fig-home-ranges-wiltshire-sampled24h. The median home range size is 0.56 km<sup>2</sup> for the sampled data, which is roughly half as much as for the full data.

Similar differences in order of magnitude between remote and rural fox home ranges can also be observed for the monthly home range results shown as a boxplot in @fig-home-ranges-boxplot. Note that outliers are removed, in particular the irregular data for Herschel (as seen in @fig-herschel-map). The accompanying monthly home range plots can be found in the Appendix in @fig-monthly-home-ranges-wiltshire, @fig-monthly-home-ranges-bylot, and @fig-monthly-home-ranges-herschel.

For habitat selection, there are 11 categories: tree cover, shrubland, grassland, cropland, built-up, bare/sparse vegetation, snow and ice, permanent water bodies, herbaceous wetland, mangroves, moss and lichen.

# Discussion

The fox home range results differ enormously between rural and remote areas. We conclude that human presence impacts fox movement behavior significantly, with availability of anthropogenic food sources likely being relevant. The influence of technical aspects, like sampling intervals, on home range calculation results is significant. Wiltshire fox home ranges are overestimated in comparison to Bylot fox home ranges, because of the higher amount of data points available. It also demonstrates that the influence of sampling intervals is definitely present. However, it plays a secondary role in comparison to the difference in fox behavior, which enables the chosen approach of comparing data from heterogeneous sources.

It is interesting to see that the fox home ranges for Bylot and Herschel are similar, even if the islands are different in size with Bylot being a hundred times larger. Note that there is one fox with an extraordinarily large home range in @fig-home-ranges-wiltshire. @kobryn2023foxes report similar patterns with a small number of foxes covering much larger areas than others. They conclude that potential for extensive movement patterns in urban foxes exists, and that in some studies such outlier data is either removed or not trackable to begin with because of hardware setup restrictions, therefore underestimating home ranges. In this case there are no such issues, however for most of the foxes a small home range can be observed.

TBD Note that the habitat selection results are not in line with what the original paper by @prugh2023fear found. Their insight was that in intact ecosystems, large carnivores have a regulating influence on smaller predators such as coyotes, but in ecosystems with humans presence, smaller predators animals prefer developed areas to avoid larger predators. In our case, large carnivore data was not included in the analysis.

## Model validation

According to @rykiel1996testing, model validation means demonstrating that a model is acceptable for its intended use. The purpose, criteria, and context of the model must be specified.

For the purpose of home range comparison, two models were defined comprised of data, home range calculation based on minimum convex polygons, and median selection. The validation criteria required the amount of difference between the results to be significantly larger (i.e., by a factor of more than 10 times) than the effects on the results introduced by data properties. For that order of magnitude, @nilsen2008can found that the choice of home range estimator has a secondary impact compared to range size differences.

Since the geographic location context was diverse, to exclude distortions in the coordinate system as a potential unwanted influence, the results for Bylot island were spot checked for three applicable coordinate systems: WGS84 geographic coordinate system (EPSG:4326), NAD 83 / Statistics Canada Lambert projection (EPSG:3347), and Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) zone 17N (EPSG:2958). These were identified using the [CRS Explorer](https://crs-explorer.proj.org/). The differences in the median home rage size results (UK wader season) for the foxes in Bylot were minor: 75.3 km<sup>2</sup> for WGS84, 73.3 km<sup>2</sup> for EPSG:3347, and 75.8 km<sup>2</sup> for EPSG:2958.

For the habitat selection TBD

Human activity influences home range sizes and habitat selection significantly.
