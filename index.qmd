# Abstract

We investigate how human activity influences the movement patterns of wild animals. Using tracking data from red foxes and coyotes across rural and remote areas in England, Canada, and the US, we analyze home range sizes and habitat selection in relation to human footprint and land cover.

# Introduction

Disturbance by humans has widespread impacts on the movements of animals, as confirmed by a large-scale meta study @doherty2021human. In this paper, two related research questions are addressed:

1.  Home range size implications: Do animals exhibit smaller home ranges in high human impact areas?\
This is examined by comparing red fox (*vulpes vulpes*) home ranges in low and high human impact areas.
2.  Habitat selection in human-influenced landscapes: How do animals select habitats under varying levels of human presence? This is analysed based on bobcat (*lynx rufus*) and coyote (*canis latrans*) data from a national park area.

Together, these analyses allow us to evaluate both large-scale home range adjustments and fine-scale habitat preferences in response to human activity.

# Data and methods

<!--This section describes the datasets, the steps taken to prepare and process the different datasets in use, and the methodological approach.-->

## Datasets

<!--The Movebank database @kays2022movebank allows researchers to publish animal tracking data for public use. Relying on externally contributed data presents challenges because data is used for purposes it was not originally collected for, and compared between studies. We selected red fox data for outskirt areas in Wiltshire, UK @porteus2024movement and for uninhabited islands in Canada @lai2022red, and bobcat and coyote data for remote areas in northeastern Washington, US @prugh2023fear. Additional, the global terrestrial human footprint @gassert2023operational and satellite land cover data @zanaga2022esa were employed.-->

We analyzed four animal tracking datasets obtained from the Movebank database @kays2022movebank, including red fox (*Vulpes vulpes*) tracks from Wiltshire, UK @porteus2024movement, Bylot Island, Canada, and Herschel Island, Canada @lai2022red, as well as bobcat (*Lynx rufus*) and coyote (*Canis latrans*) tracks from northeastern Washington, USA @prugh2023fear. The tracking data varied in temporal resolution and geographic context, with sample sizes and data characteristics summarized in @tbl-datasets.

| Washington | Bobcat    | 2014–2015  | 36          | 4-hour programmed     | 48813       |

In addition to movement data, we used global covariate datasets: the 2020 global terrestrial Human Footprint Index (HFP-100) at 100 m resolution [@gassert2023operational], and the ESA WorldCover 2021 land cover dataset at 10 m resolution [@zanaga2022esa].

<!--## Data preparation and processing

### Movebank {#sec-movebank}

All Movebank datasets have the same schema. This simplifies enables code re-use, and requires data contributors do perform preprocessing on their side to provide the data in an appropriate format. Libraries for data processing and trajectory handling in R are provided @kranstauber2024move2 @signer2019animal.

The R code for data download, preprocessing, and serialization of data and charts can be found in: [Red fox: UK wader nesting season home ranges](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_uk_wader_nesting_season_home_range.html), [Red fox: montly home ranges](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_monthly_home_ranges.html), [Bobcat/coyote: data preparation and statistical modelling](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_SSF_complete.html).

### Human footprint

The global 100 meter resolution terrestrial human footprint data (HFP-100) is raster data using Mollweide projection @lapaine2011mollweide. The 2020 version of the data was downloaded for Washington, and projected to the WGS84 coordinate system: [HFP-100 download](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_HFP_subsetting.html).

### Land cover

The relevant European Space Agency (ESA) WorldCover 2021 data at 10 m resolution was downloaded via the Microsoft Planetary Computer [STAC API](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/docs/quickstarts/reading-stac/): [ESA download](https://elkeelke.github.io/MovebankProject/preprocessing_ESA_world_cover.html).-->

## Exploratory data assessment

### Red fox {#sec-redfoxdata}

Data from Wiltshire (@fig-wiltshire-map) were collected between 2016 to 2019 during the UK wader nesting season, defined as March 15th to June 15th, for a total of 35 foxes. Locations were recorded every 10 to 60 minutes, with the sampling rate remotely reduced during periods deemed less informative to conserve battery.

Data from Bylot (@fig-bylot-map) and Herschel (@fig-herschel-map) were collected year-round, at a lower sampling rate of once per day at random afternoon times. Data collection spanned 2009–2010 for Herschel and 2011–2015 for Bylot, with two foxes monitored per island. @fig-datapoints-year shows annual data availability, highlighting the much larger dataset from Wiltshire due to more animals and higher sampling frequency. Monthly patterns @fig-datapoints-month reveal seasonal differences in data availability.

### Bobcat and coyote

Coyote and bobcat GPS were collected in northeastern Washington between 2014 and 2015, with collars programmed to record locations every four hours. The two species occupied two distinct geographic areas with overlapping but species-specific home ranges @fig-esa, shown in relation to land cover data. Human footprint was generally low across the study area, except for localized settlements and roads @fig-hfp.

Although collars were programmed for regular sampling, actual intervals were irregular, with substantial variation, especially among bobcats. Sampling interval distributions are shown in @fig-sampling-rates.

## Analytical methods {#sec-methodology}

We applied two analytical approaches: (1) home range estimation for red foxes and (2) habitat selection modeling using step-selection functions for coyotes.

### Home range size assessment

We estimated home range sizes using minimum convex polygons (MCP), providing standardized, comparable measures of space use across individuals. However, differences in temporal scale between the datasets posed challenges for comparability. The Wiltshire data were sampled at 10–60 minute intervals, while the Bylot and Herschel datasets were sampled once daily. Additionally, data coverage varied across seasons and years, and sample sizes differed substantially.

These discrepancies introduce potential biases in home range estimation @laube2011. To mitigate these effects, we employed three strategies:

1. We limited analyses to the same seasonal period (March 15th – June 15th) across datasets to control for seasonal variation. Due to limited data from Herschel Island (@fig-datapoints-month) for that timeframe, we focused comparative analyses on the Wiltshire and Bylot datasets.

2. We generated a downsampled Wiltshire dataset by selecting a random daily location per individual, matching the lower sampling frequency of the Arctic datasets.

3. We computed monthly home ranges for all datasets to explore temporal variation.

<!--Home range sizes were calculated using minimum convex polygons, which provides easily comparable estimates of the area used by each individual animal. As discussed in @sec-redfoxdata, the datasets for the two locations have different temporal scale. The choice of temporal scale has considerable effects on movement parameter calculations @laube2011, in turn affecting home range results. How to make this data comparable? Problem #1 is that the sampling intervals are different. Problem #2 is that the data coverage varies by time of the year. Problem #3 is that there are highly different amounts of data. Selecting the means and parameters for the comparison involves complex choices that will influence the results. For #1, a possible approach to achieve similar sampling intervals would be to sample a random afternoon data point for each 24 hour window. However, this would include the implicit assumption that foxes will follow similar daily patterns in the different environments. For #2, a possible approach would be to compare the data for the same time of the year. But since the geographical locations are different, the seasonal weather conditions will differ for the same day of the year, likely leading to different animal behavior. For #3, aggregated comparisons can solve the issue, assuming there is enough data for the smaller data source.

For data exploration the simplest possible imperfect approach was employed, which was to ignore the different sampling intervals for problem #1, to compare the data for the same time of the year for problem #2 even if animal behavior might be different, and to use exploratory data analysis to find out if a representative answer can be found given the amount of data present for problem #3. Note that this approach has obvious limits. Among them is that the Herschel data is not applicable, since it has minimal overlaps with the Wiltshire data (@fig-datapoints-month). To explore the impact of sampling intervals for problem #1, the home ranges for the Wiltshire data were additionally calculated on downsampled data, where a random data point from every 24 hour period was selected. Finally, an analysis of monthly home ranges was conducted on all three datasets as an alternative solution to address problem #2.-->

### Habitat selection modeling

To model fine-scale habitat preferences, we used step-selection functions (SSFs) @fortin2005wolves. These compare environmental attributes at "used" locations to those at randomly sampled "available" locations along the animal’s movement path. This allows to quantify how animals respond to environmental covariates, such as human footprint and land cover. Selection patterns are then compared to assess how habitat preferences vary with human influence.

#### Step Generation and Covariates {#sec-step-cov}

Coyote and bobcat GPS tracks @prugh2023fear were irregularly spaced (@fig-bobcat-coyote-sampling) and were resampled for temporal consistency — coyotes to 4-hour intervals and bobcats to 8-hour intervals, both with a 10-minute tolerance - using the `amt::track_resample` function @signer2019animal. Steps were then generated using the `amt::steps_by_burst` and `amt::random_steps` functions. For each used step, ten random available steps were generated based on empirical step length (gamma distribution) and turning angle (Von Mises distribution). Log-transformed step lengths were calculated for modeling to account for potential bias in the availability distribution.

Each observed step and its corresponding random steps were grouped into strata using a unique step ID, following a matched case-control design @prugh2023fear. Habitat covariates (land cover and human footprint) were extracted for each step endpoint.

Land cover was reclassified into five ecologically meaningful categories to improve interpretability and model convergence (@tbl-landcover-reclass). Human footprint index (HFP) values were standardized across the dataset for modeling. 

Table: Reclassification of ESA WorldCover classes into five ecologically meaningful categories. {#tbl-landcover-reclass}

|**New class**| **Description**                        | **Used original classes**                         |
|:------------|:---------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------|
| TreeCover   | Tree-dominated areas (>10% cover)      | Tree Cover                                        |
| Open        | Open natural or low-intensity land use | Grassland, Bare/sparse vegetation, Moss & lichen  |
| Cropland    | Intensive agricultural areas           | Cropland                                          |
| BuiltUp     | Developed areas with infrastructure    | Built-up                                          |
| Water       | Aquatic & semi-aquatic environments    | Permanent water bodies, Herbaceous wetland        |

Refer to the [ESA WorldCover user manual](https://worldcover2021.esa.int/data/docs/WorldCover_PUM_V2.0.pdf) for detailed original class definitions.

To assess the distribution of human footprint across land cover types, we visualized the HFP values at used locations using a ridgeline density plot (@fig-coy-eda-ridge). The figure illustrates that TreeCover was generally associated with lower human footprint, while BuiltUp and Cropland had higher HFP values, supporting the relevance of the interaction terms in our model. As a complementary visualization to the ridgeline plot, we include a boxplot in the Appendix showing the spread of human footprint values across land cover types (@fig-coy-eda-box).

![Ridgeline density plot of human footprint index across land cover types at used locations.](img/coyote_EDA_ridgeline.png){#fig-coy-eda-ridge width="100%" .lightbox}

To explore the relationship between movement behavior and human disturbance, we visualized the joint distribution of the Human Footprint Index (HFP) and log-transformed step length using a hexbin density plot (@fig-coy-eda-hex). Most steps occurred under conditions of low human footprint and were characterized by short to moderate movement distances. By including log-transformed step length as a covariate, the model accounts for underlying variation in movement intensity that could otherwise confound habitat selection estimates.

![Joint distribution of human footprint index and log-transformed step length for coyotes, with the red contour marking the 95% density region.](img/coyote_EDA_hexbin.png){#fig-coy-eda-hex width="100%" .lightbox}

#### Statistical model

Step selection functions (SSFs) are commonly modeled using conditional logistic regression, which compares observed and available steps within matched strata (e.g., `survival::clogit`; @manly2007resource). However, for datasets involving multiple individuals, this approach can be limiting in terms of flexibility. Since conditional logistic regression is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson regression model with stratum-specific fixed intercepts, these can be treated as random effects with a large fixed variance @muff2020accounting. By treating these intercepts as random effects with a large fixed variance, the model can be reformulated as a generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM), allowing for the inclusion of random slopes to account for individual variation in habitat selection.

Following this framework, we modeled habitat selection in relation to human impact using a Poisson GLMM with a log link, implemented via `glmmTMB::glmmTMB`. Stratum-specific intercepts (one per `step_id_`) were modeled as random effects with a fixed, large variance to approximate the conditional logistic structure, enabling the inclusion of individual-level random slopes and better capturing heterogeneity in selection behavior.

The fixed effects included a two-way interaction between land cover class and both the linear and quadratic terms of standardized human footprint, as well as the natural logarithm of step length (`log_sl_`) to control for movement bias. Human footprint index (HFP) values were standardized before modeling. 

The model can be expressed as:

$$
\log(\lambda_{ij}) =
\beta_1 \cdot \text{LC}_{ij} +
\beta_2 \cdot \text{HFP}_{ij} +
\beta_3 \cdot \text{HFP}_{ij}^2 +
\beta_4 \cdot \ln(\text{SL}_{ij}) +
b_{0,step(i,j)} +
u_{i}
$$

where:

- $\lambda_{ij}$ is the expected relative selection strength for step $j$ of individual $i$,  
- $\text{LC}_{ij}$ is the land cover class,  
- $\text{HFP}_{ij}$ is the standardized human footprint value,
- $\text{SL}_{ij}$ is the step length,
- $b_{0,\text{step}(i,j)}$ is a random intercept for each stratum (`step_id_`),  
- $u_i$ represents individual-level random slopes.

Interaction terms between land cover and human footprint (both linear and quadratic) were also included but are omitted here for clarity.

Following model fitting, we used average marginal effects and relative selection strength (RSS) to visualize how habitat selection varied across the human footprint gradient. These metrics were computed from the fitted model to provide an interpretable measure of selection intensity.

#### Bobcat data exclusion

We initially attempted SSF modeling for bobcats, but excluded them from the final analysis due to insufficient sample sizes across land cover types and irregular sampling intervals. These issues led to poor model convergence and biologically implausible estimates. Only two land cover classes remained after filtering, limiting ecological interpretability. As a result, SSF analysis was conducted only for coyotes.

# Results

## Fox home ranges

Fox home ranges during the time period corresponding to the UK wader nesting season are visualized as proportional circles in @fig-home-ranges-map, providing a comparative overview of median range sizes across Bylot and Wiltshire. Individual home range areas are further summarized in @fig-home-range-sizes, where each point represents one animal’s estimated range size. The median home range in Bylot (75.3 km²) was over 65 times larger than in Wiltshire (1.1 km²). When subsampling the Wiltshire data to a 24-hour interval, the median home range decreased to 0.56 km².

## Coyote habitat selection

The final step selection function (SSF) model included 666,248 steps from 29 coyotes. The model converged successfully and revealed significant effects of human footprint and land cover interactions on habitat selection.

Coyotes exhibited significant variation in habitat selection across land cover types and along the human footprint gradient (@tbl-emtrends-linear and @tbl-emtrends-quadratic). Linear selection trends were significantly positive in TreeCover ($\beta_1$ = +0.263, *p* = 0.0001) and Open ($\beta_1$ = +0.139, *p* = 0.042), indicating increased selection with increasing HFP at low to moderate levels. However, significant negative quadratic trends in these habitats (TreeCover: $\beta_2$ = -0.183, *p* < 0.0001; Open: $\beta_2$ = -0.181, *p* < 0.0001) suggested that selection peaked at intermediate HFP and declined at higher human footprint levels.

Selection for Cropland and BuiltUp was weak and non-significant (*p* > 0.05). Water showed a significant negative linear trend ($\beta_1$ = -0.550, *p* = 0.036), indicating declining selection with increasing HFP.

## Model validation

<!--Model validation means demonstrating that a model is acceptable for its intended use @rykiel1996testing. The purpose, criteria, and context of the model must be specified.-->

### Fox home ranges

To validate the home range estimation, we evaluated the influence of coordinate system choice and data properties on the results. Specifically, we compared median home range sizes calculated using minimum convex polygons (MCP) across three coordinate systems: WGS84 (EPSG:4326), NAD83 (EPSG:3347), and UTM Zone 17N (EPSG:2958), identified using the CRS Explorer. The differences in median home range area were small (75.3 km² for WGS84, 73.3 km² for NAD83, and 75.8 km² for UTM Zone 17N), suggesting minimal distortion effects. Our validation criterion required that any coordinate system effect be an order of magnitude smaller than observed ecological differences (≥10x smaller) @nilsen2008can. Given this threshold was met, we considered the choice of coordinate system to have negligible impact on home range estimates.

<!--For home range sizes, two models comprised of data, home range calculation based on minimum convex polygons, and median selection were compared. The validation criteria required the difference between the results to be at least 10 times larger than the effects on the results introduced by data properties. For that order of magnitude, the choice of home range estimator has a secondary impact @nilsen2008can. Since geographic location contexts were diverse, to exclude distortions in the coordinate system as a potential influence, the results for Bylot island were spot checked for three applicable coordinate systems: WGS84 (EPSG:4326), NAD 83 (EPSG:3347), and UTM zone 17N (EPSG:2958). These were identified using the [CRS Explorer](https://crs-explorer.proj.org/). The differences in the median home range size results were minor: 75.3 km<sup>2</sup> for WGS84, 73.3 km<sup>2</sup> for NAD 83, and 75.8 km<sup>2</sup> for UTM zone 17N.-->

### Coyote habitat selection

For the habitat selection, model validity was assessed by inspecting fixed and random effect estimates, checking for overdispersion, evaluating collinearity among predictors, and plotting predicted values against observed use categories (@fig-pred-vs-used). No overdispersion was detected (dispersion ratio = 0.91; *p* = 1). Multicollinearity was low among main effects (VIF < 5); high variance inflation for interaction terms was expected due to model structure. Predicted relative use values were higher for used steps compared to available steps, indicating biologically plausible model behavior. Standard residual-based diagnostics were not feasible due to the conditional logistic nature of the step selection framework.

# Discussion

## Home range size assessment

The fox home range size results show enormous differences between rural and remote areas. We conclude that human presence changes fox movement behavior patterns fundamentally. The opportunity to move undisturbed, and the availability of anthropogenic food sources are likely the most relevant factors. Interestingly, home range sizes for Bylot and Herschel foxes are similar, even if the island sizes differ by a factor of 100. Note that there is one fox with an extraordinarily large home range in @fig-home-ranges-wiltshire. The additional charts in @sec-additional-charts show several instances of large fox movements within a single month. Similar patterns with a small number of foxes covering much larger areas than others were found in @kobryn2023foxes, concluding that the data is genuine and demonstrates potential for extensive movement patterns in urban foxes. 

While technical aspects such as sampling intervals and home range estimator have significant influence on the calculation results, they play a secondary role in comparison to the difference in fox behavior, which enables the chosen approach of comparing data from heterogeneous sources. 

## Habitat selection

Coyote habitat selection was driven by both land cover and the degree of human modification. Animals strongly favored forest and open habitats under low-to-moderate human footprint but reduced use of these habitats once disturbance exceeded an apparent threshold, indicating a trade-off between resource gain and risk. Cropland, built-up areas, and water were rarely selected, revealing broad avoidance of highly modified landscapes.

Land-cover-specific relative selection strength (RSS) curves showed that human disturbance altered preferences differently among habitats—selection for forest declined more steeply with increasing footprint than did selection for open areas—echoing earlier work that forests function as crucial refuges in human-dominated settings (e.g., @riley2003effects). Model diagnostics confirmed that the SSF was well specified, with no over-dispersion or problematic collinearity. A comparable analysis for bobcats was infeasible because of sparse, uneven data, underscoring the limitations of opportunistic tracking datasets.

# Conclusion

We have performed spatial data analysis and statistical modeling on externally contributed publicly available data to demonstrate that human activity influences animal behavior significantly. We could show that (1) fox home range sizes are larger in remote areas, and that (2) coyotes prefer forests over built-up areas for habitat selection depending on human footprint.
